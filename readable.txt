In this course we will use the Kotlin programming language.

In my experience, students develop a style of programming in their first programming laguage. They find it difficult to lean a different style later, even if they switch to a different language. This means that students should start early to use a modern language that encourages writing clean and elegant code, and suppports a good object-oriented and funtional style.

We will therefore use Kotlin in this course. Kotlin is fully compatible with Java, so you can use it for anything that can be done in java, but it is a much more modern, much more readable, and much more sensible language. We will also experiemnt with compiling Kotlin source to Javascript, so you can run your programs inside a web browser, and will even write small apps that can run on Android phones. 

Most students will still have to learn C++ and/or Java later during their students-but I believe that after getting programming practice in Kotlin, they will be able to write better code in those languages as well.
